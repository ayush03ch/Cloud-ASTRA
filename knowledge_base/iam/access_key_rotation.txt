# IAM Access Key Rotation Best Practices

Keywords: access-keys, iam, credentials, security, rotation

## Overview

IAM access keys should be rotated regularly to reduce the risk of compromised credentials.

## Common Issues

### Old Access Keys
Access keys that haven't been rotated in 90+ days increase security risk.

**Severity**: HIGH

**Detection**: AccessKey CreateDate is older than 90 days and Status is Active

### Multiple Active Keys
Users with multiple active access keys make key management difficult.

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Detection**: User has more than one active AccessKey

### Unused Access Keys
Active keys that haven't been used recently should be deactivated.

**Severity**: MEDIUM

**Detection**: AccessKey LastUsedDate is older than 90 days but Status is Active

## Best Practices

1. **Rotate Regularly**: Rotate access keys every 90 days
2. **One Active Key**: Users should have only one active access key at a time
3. **Deactivate Unused Keys**: Deactivate keys that haven't been used in 90 days
4. **Use IAM Roles**: Prefer IAM roles over access keys when possible
5. **Audit Key Usage**: Monitor CloudTrail for access key usage patterns

## Remediation Steps

### Rotate Access Key
```
# Create new key
aws iam create-access-key \
    --user-name USERNAME

# After updating applications with new key
# Deactivate old key
aws iam update-access-key \
    --user-name USERNAME \
    --access-key-id OLD_KEY_ID \
    --status Inactive

# After verification, delete old key
aws iam delete-access-key \
    --user-name USERNAME \
    --access-key-id OLD_KEY_ID
```

### Deactivate Unused Key
```
aws iam update-access-key \
    --user-name USERNAME \
    --access-key-id KEY_ID \
    --status Inactive
```

## Intent-Specific Recommendations

### least_privilege Intent
- Rotate keys frequently (30-60 days)
- Use temporary credentials when possible
- Implement key rotation automation

### compliance Intent
- Document key rotation procedures
- Automated rotation reminders
- Audit trail of all key operations

### strong_security Intent
- Consider certificate-based authentication
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for key storage
- Implement break-glass procedures
